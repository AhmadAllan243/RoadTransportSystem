# RoadTransportSystem

This is a Road Transport System database, it has busses, routes, bus stops, route stops, and other relations to complete the database. All PK and FK relations are specified.

The SQL code creates all the tables needed in the database, and inserts values into them, and there are also example queries.

The C++ extracts certain routes from a database we created, you can enter any stop name and you will get all the routes to that stop as an output
